# CAT-06 — PRD adoption and promotion

**Status — 2026-10-21 17:44 UTC: BLOCKED before PRD mutation.** The frozen
release `cat-20261021-ebc4446` remains accepted in Dev and QAS. No PRD service,
selector, database, backup, receipt, journal, mailbox, or ACK was changed in
this check. Filesystem-mailbox acceptance remains **NOT RUN**.

## Read-only production baseline

The current PRD preflight used the synchronized source checkout at
`363ef81c4f03dcad3cd5d9c0483845f590e36dc8`; its tracked `src/` bytes match the
accepted ebc4446 source. Mac used the Makefile's Go 1.27.1 toolchain and its
shared Go caches. Worker preflights used the explicit Go 1.27.1 toolchain in
their clean `dev` checkouts and strict SSH host-key verification. The commands
were `runner-lane prd-preflight --host HOST` on each host. This command calls
`ReadPRDPreflight`, which uses the read-only restart-preflight SQLite opener;
it does not use `store.Open`, run migrations, or write the database.

The current exact PRD binary hashes are also present in the emitted preflight
JSON. No installed source revision was inferred from them. All four services
remain on their unsuffixed legacy installation; PRD selectors remain
unselected. Dev and QAS were not changed.

The owner-provided Sandbox transcript shows `sudo rm -rf *` in
`/var/log/journal` and about 1.5 GB free afterward. Runner did not run that
command or modify journal files. A later read-only SSH measurement at
`2026-10-21T17:37:43Z` reported `/dev/sda1` and `/tmp` with 1,422,868,480 bytes
available (98% used). The lower preflight measurement above is the conservative
capacity input. The estimated PRD backup fits at that observation, but no
backup was created. Re-measure the actual requirement immediately before any
backup, stage, or selector operation.

The preflight counters show no active sessions, queued commands, running
commands, resumable jobs, or pending recovery finalizations. They do show
unreleased terminal work reservations: Mac 3, Linux 1, Sandbox 3, Factory 0.
The last exact read-only pair inventory classified all seven retained pairs as
`lost` in command, job, session, and teardown state; their stop/release and
cleanup/release timestamps were unset. The current preflight reconfirmed the
counts but did not re-enumerate pair identities, so exact identities and
process ownership must be refreshed immediately before supported recovery.
No scripts or payloads were read, replayed, deleted, or acknowledged.

The current turn did not independently verify the external publisher controls.
The owner’s pause instruction remains in force; the exact publisher-control
evidence must be captured before PRD admissions are fenced or services are
stopped.

## CAT-06 execution blocker

The accepted ebc4446 operator has no supported way to create the initial PRD
cohort receipt and its host preflights:

- `runner-lane catalog-cohort --action create` rejects PRD at
  `src/cmd/runner-lane/main.go:336-340`.
- `NewCatalogCohortReceipt` accepts only Dev/QAS at
  `src/internal/laneinstall/catalog_cohort.go:171-177`, despite the receipt
  validator supporting PRD receipts.
- `catalog-host-preflight` rejects PRD at
  `src/cmd/runner-lane/main.go:867-870`, and cohort `preflight` rejects PRD
  at `src/cmd/runner-lane/main.go:489-492`.
- `BeginCatalogPRDMaintenance` requires that the same PRD operation already
  be recorded as the unique local admission hold
  (`src/internal/laneinstall/catalog_prd.go:73-82`). This leaves no supported
  command path to produce and synchronize the first PRD hold after consistent
  backup and quiescence checks. The host-local `catalog-prd-backup` command
  does not create or synchronize the four-host cohort receipt.
- For an unselected legacy PRD selector, `readPRDCatalogProof` deliberately
  sets `readSchemaMax = 0` until tested cohort evidence exists
  (`src/internal/laneinstall/catalog_prd.go:440-445`). The old binaries have no
  catalog manifest declaring their read compatibility. A source change must
  bind the exact legacy bundle identity to actual compatibility evidence; it
  must not fill this field from the database schema number alone.

The seven terminal-lost reservations are a separate work guard. The existing
supported recovery procedure can dispose only freshly revalidated exact pairs
after selected services are stopped. No stop or recovery was attempted here.

## Required correction and sequence

Before selecting PRD, add and test a supported PRD host-preflight and
coordinator receipt path. It must preserve the current PRD restriction on
ordinary installers; require explicit publisher-pause evidence; use fresh
service/work/ownership facts; bind exact legacy binary and configuration
identities; create verified consistent backups; and record tested
previous-binary/current-data compatibility. Receipt creation and synchronization
must remain supported APIs; no manual receipt editing is acceptable.

Because that is a source change, it requires source gates and Git delivery,
then a **new sealed release identity** and renewed full acceptance in Dev and
QAS before PRD. The ebc4446 candidate remains unchanged and must not be
re-labeled to include the correction. After those gates, refresh exact retained
work identities and publisher controls, use only supported recovery, recheck
Sandbox capacity, create and synchronize the PRD hold, then follow the fixed
worker order and final Mac switch. The prior installation/restart authorization
remains scoped to this approved catalog migration, conditional on those gates.

At this evidence point no PRD backup, hold, service stop/restart, release
publication, selector change, functional probe, request, or ACK was performed.
